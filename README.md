>This repo includes the code for camera calibration and detecting distance from the camera.  

> First you have to generate images using the images of a checkerboard img for calibration of camera using the cam_cal_img_gem.py file.  
> When you run the image generator you have to move around the chessboard image printed on a A4 size sheet. Move the sheet around and at different angles to make sure a better camera calibration. ( About 100 images would be enough it takes about 1 img per sec).  
> Then you have to run the cam_cal.py for calibration of camera for the lens distortion.  
> Now run detect.py to detect the distance of marker from the camera.

> Detection of rotation and position estimation is under progress please do not edit the code.
